# Clean-up
* clean-up data structures, put everything in one struct
* work directly in structs directly (are struct operations permanent across function calls?) --> make something like OO approach

# Improvements
* introduce time varying constants
* introduce stagewise constants
* allow for named body indices and references

# New Features
